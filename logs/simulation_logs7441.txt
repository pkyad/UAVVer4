UAV 6 is now in the search mode 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 1 is free 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 2 is free 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 3 is free 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 4 is free 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 5 is free 
UAV 6 interpreted that UAV 6 is free 
UAV 6 assinged itself the target no. 5  
This simulation has 6 free UAVs so there will be two groups 
UAV 6 belongs to group 1 
UAV 6 is now in track mode 
UAV 4 belongs to group 1 
UAV 4 is now in track mode 
UAV 5 belongs to group 1 
UAV 5 is now in track mode 
UAV 6 belongs to group 1 and is the Leader 
UAV 4 belongs to group 1 and is the 2nd UAV 
UAV 5 belongs to group 1 and is the 3rd UAV 
Elapsed time is 126.641726 seconds.
