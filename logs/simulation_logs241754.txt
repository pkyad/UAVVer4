UAV 1 is now in the search mode 
UAV 3 is now in the search mode 
UAV 5 is now in the search mode 
UAV 6 is now in the search mode 
UAV 2 is now in the search mode 
UAV 4 is now in the search mode 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 1 is free 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 2 is free 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 3 is free 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 4 is free 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 5 is free 
UAV 1 interpreted that UAV 6 is free 
UAV 1 assinged itself the target no. 5  
This simulation has 6 free UAVs so there will be two groups 
UAV 1 belongs to group 1 
UAV 1 is now in track mode 
UAV 6 belongs to group 1 
UAV 6 is now in track mode 
UAV 2 belongs to group 1 
UAV 2 is now in track mode 
UAV 1 belongs to group 1 and is the Leader 
UAV 2 belongs to group 1 and is the 2nd UAV 
UAV 6 belongs to group 1 and is the 3rd UAV 
UAV 3 interpreted that UAV 3 is free 
UAV 3 interpreted that UAV 4 is free 
UAV 3 interpreted that UAV 5 is free 
UAV 3 assinged itself the target no. 10  
This simulation has 3 free UAVs so there will be only one group 
UAV 3 belongs to group 2 
UAV 3 is now in the track mode 
UAV 4 belongs to group 2 
UAV 4 is now in the track mode 
UAV 5 belongs to group 2 
UAV 5 is now in the track mode 
UAV 3 belongs to group 2 and is the Leader 
UAV 4 belongs to group 2 and is the 2nd UAV 
UAV 5 belongs to group 2 and is the 3rd UAV 
Elapsed time is 195.740084 seconds.
